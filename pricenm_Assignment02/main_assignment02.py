# Brief Description: This project attempts to meet the requirements laid out in the document
# Citations: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16451978/extracting-single-letters-out-of-a-string-in-python &
# Anything else that's relevant:

# 1. Store fizz and print fizz -1
fizz = 99
print(fizz - 1)

# 2. Store gamma and print gamma content plus fizz contents
gamma = ("University of Southern Ohio")
print(gamma, fizz)

# 3. Store delta, add fizz and delta, store under epsilon and print epsilon
delta = 1.5
epsilon = fizz + delta
print(epsilon)

# 4. compose an expression that extracts the 'v' in the variable gamma, store that result in eta
# and print the contents of eta bracketed by ">" and "<"
eta = gamma[3]
print(">",eta,"<")

# 5. store 1234.5 in nu, print nu contents to console,  write an expression that adds contents of delta
# and fizz stores the results in zeta and print the value of zeta to the console
nu = 1234.5
print(nu)
zeta = delta + fizz
print(zeta)
